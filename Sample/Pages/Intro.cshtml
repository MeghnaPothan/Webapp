        <h2>About of ASP.NET</h2>
        <p>
            ASP.NET is an open-source,[2] server-side web-application framework designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages.
            It was developed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites, applications and services.
            The name stands for Active Server Pages Network Enabled Technologies.
            It was first released in January 2002 with version 1.0 of the .NET Framework and is the successor to Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) technology.
            ASP.NET is built on the Common Language Runtime (CLR), allowing programmers to write ASP.NET code using any supported .NET language.
            The ASP.NET SOAP extension framework allows ASP.NET components to process SOAP messages.
